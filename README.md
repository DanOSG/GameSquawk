   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=database_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```

#### Setting up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd GameSquawk/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   # For local development
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   
   # For production with domain (uncomment when deploying)
   # REACT_APP_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Production Deployment

#### Domain Configuration
1. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to your server IP
2. Configure Nginx:
   ```
   server {
       server_name yourdomain.com;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
       
       location /api {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
       
       location /socket.io {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

#### SSL Configuration
1. Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:
   ```
   apt update && apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. Obtain and configure SSL certificate:
   ```
   certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```

3. Update frontend environment:
   ```
   # frontend/.env

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Dependency Compatibility Issues
If you encounter errors related to dependencies when installing or running the application (especially with React 19), use the following commands:

For react-mde (markdown editor):
```
npm install react-mde --legacy-peer-deps
```

For socket.io-client (real-time communication):
```
npm install socket.io-client --legacy-peer-deps
```

These issues occur because some packages have peer dependencies on older React versions, but the project uses React 19. The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag allows npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts.

### SSL/HTTPS Issues
If you encounter mixed content warnings:
1. Ensure your `.env` file has `REACT_APP_API_URL` set to use `https://` protocol
2. Rebuild the frontend application after making changes
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
